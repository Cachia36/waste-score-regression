# Waste Score Regression

This project demonstrates regression modeling applied to waste management data. It aims to predict a country's waste management performance **Score** based on features such as the amount of waste **Generated**, **Recycling** rates, and **Incineration** levels.

ðŸ“Œ **Purpose**: Built as part of my data science portfolio to showcase real-world data analysis, feature engineering, regression modeling, and data visualization skills.
